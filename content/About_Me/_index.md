# Hello, I'm Jeremy Wojak

Welcome to my personal website. I'm a Robotics and Electronics Engineer with a passion for turning complex challenges into elegant, automated solutions. Having recently graduated from Flinders University with a Bachelor of Engineering (Robotics) (Honours) and a Master of Engineering (Electronics), I'm driven by a curiosity to understand and innovate at the intersection of hardware and software.

This space is where I'll be sharing my journey, projects, and the experiences that have shaped my engineering career.
## My Professional Journey
My time at Flinders University, where I achieved a GPA of 6.24/7.00 and received the Chancellor's Letter of Commendation in 2021, 2023, and 2025, provided a strong theoretical and practical foundation. The hands-on projects were where I truly thrived. From programming autonomous robots with IR, ultrasonic, and LiDAR sensors to designing control systems for DC motors, I was able to apply classroom knowledge to real-world applications. A highlight of my university experience was winning the university-wide Warman Design and Build Challenge in 2021 and then achieving second place at the state-wide level. My team and I designed and built a robot to autonomously deposit tennis balls into tubes, a challenge that tested our design, programming, and teamwork skills.

My Master's project focused on Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) for low-cost electrolysis cells. I redesigned a benchmark alkaline water electrolysis cell to be suitable for automated manufacturing, with a focus on reducing part counts and production costs to make the technology more accessible.
## Industry Experience
I believe in bridging the gap between academic theory and industry application. My work experiences have been invaluable in shaping my skills and understanding of the engineering world.
### Graduate Engineer at Simbiant
As a Graduate Engineer at Simbiant, I completed the Electronic Warfare graduate program, which gave me a solid foundation in Electronic Attack, Protection, and Support. I contributed to a defense project developing an AI-driven waveform communications system using GNURadio and Python. This role also involved creating Python scripts to automate data processing and working with Software-Defined Radio (SDR) platforms. I also had the opportunity to work on-site at the DSTG.
### Engineering Intern at Exail in France
My time as an Engineering Intern at Exail in France was a formative experience, made possible by being selected as a laureate of the 2023 Nicolas Baudin Program. I developed optimised path-planning software for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to improve sonar data collection for deep learning models. This involved designing and implementing path-planning algorithms, integrating the software with QGIS and other tools, and creating a user-friendly GUI with PyQt5.
### Engineering Assistant at Henstock Technologies
At Henstock Technologies, I gained extensive hands-on experience in industrial automation. I was involved in programming and testing an automated ice cream tub denesting and filling machine and developed an automated wine barrel washer. This role allowed me to extensively program PLC controllers, HMIs, and robotic arms, and implement Modbus networking for industrial communication.
## Personal Projects & Interests
Beyond my professional and academic work, I'm passionate about personal projects that allow me to explore new technologies and be creative.
*   **Self-Hosted Productivity & Data Server:** I designed and maintain a personal server running self-hosted applications like NextCloud and Immich to improve productivity and manage my data. This ongoing project has enhanced my skills in Linux system administration and network configuration.
*   **Modular Synthesizer:** As a musician who plays guitar and modular synthesizer, I've designed and built various modules, including oscillators, amplifiers, and filters. This has developed my skills in circuit design, PCB assembly, and electronic troubleshooting.
*   **Large LCD Matrix Display:** I created a large display matrix using 96 smaller LCDs, which involved developing custom drivers and communication protocols as well an algorithm to convert images to ASCII art.

When I'm not working on engineering projects, you can find me practicing gymnastics, restoring my 1980 Chrysler Lancer, or experimenting with 3D printing.
